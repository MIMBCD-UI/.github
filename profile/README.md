The [Medical Imaging Multimodality Breast Cancer Diagnosis User Interface (MIMBCD-UI)](https://mimbcd-ui.github.io/) project involves the collaborative effort of three Portuguese Research Institutions: [ISR](http://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/), [ITI](http://iti.larsys.pt/) and [INESC-ID](http://www.inesc-id.pt/). The three laboratories are [Associate Laboratories](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/research-and-innovation/rd/associate-laboratories/) of [IST](http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) from [ULisboa](https://www.ulisboa.pt/) - [Portugal](https://www.portugal.gov.pt/) ([EU](https://europa.eu/)). The project was created during the [Master Thesis](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/meic-a/dissertacao/1409728525632244) of [Francisco Maria Calisto](http://web.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/francisco.calisto/). The [MIMBCD-UI](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI) project is the precursor of both [MIDA](https://github.com/mida-project) and [BreastScreening](https://github.com/BreastScreening) projects. For further information, follow the [public wiki](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta/wiki) of the project. Moreover, we also provide a [private wiki](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta-private/tree/master/wiki) on the [`meta-private`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta-private) repository for team usage. Unfortunately, you need to be a member of our team to access the restricted information.
