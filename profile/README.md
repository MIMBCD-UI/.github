Starting in 2015, the [Medical Imaging Multimodality Breast Cancer Diagnosis User Interface (MIMBCD-UI)](https://mimbcd-ui.github.io/) initiative involves the collaborative effort of three Portuguese research institutions: [ISR-Lisboa/LARSyS](http://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/), [ITI/LARSyS](http://iti.larsys.pt/), and [INESC-ID](http://www.inesc-id.pt/). These laboratories are [Associate Laboratories](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/research-and-innovation/rd/associate-laboratories/) of [Instituto Superior Técnico (IST)](http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/), part of the [University of Lisbon (ULisboa)](https://www.ulisboa.pt/), [Portugal](https://www.portugal.gov.pt/) ([EU](https://europa.eu/)). [ISR-Lisboa/LARSyS](http://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) and [ITI/LARSyS](http://iti.larsys.pt/) are both part of the [LARSyS](https://www.larsys.pt/) research network, with ISR-Lisboa/LARSyS focusing on systems and robotics, while ITI/LARSyS is focusing on Human–Computer Interaction (HCI). Together, they bring complementary expertise to the MIMBCD-UI initiative, combining technical innovation with user-centered design.

The [MIMBCD-UI](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI) initiative is the precursor of both [MIDA](https://github.com/mida-project) and [BreastScreening](https://github.com/BreastScreening) initiatives. In 2022, the team was funded by a national [FCT](https://www.fct.pt/) project, namely [Multiple Instance Attention Learning for Multimodal Breast Cancer (MIA-BREAST)](https://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/projects/multiple-instance-attention-learning-for-multimodal-breast-cancer-diagnosis/) with the FCT reference `2022.04485.PTDC` (DOI: [10.54499/2022.04485.PTDC](https://doi.org/10.54499/2022.04485.PTDC)), receiving contributions from the [MIMBCD-UI](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI) initiative.

In 2025, the team advanced this research through a new national [FCT](https://www.fct.pt/) project entitled [Integration of an Artificial Intelligence Agent in Radiology to Assist in Breast Cancer Diagnosis](https://doi.org/10.54499/2024.07344.IACDC) with the reference `2024.07344.IACDC` (DOI: [10.54499/2024.07344.IACDC](https://doi.org/10.54499/2024.07344.IACDC)). This project, developed in collaboration with the [Centro Hospitalar de Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro (CHTMAD)](https://www.chtmad.min-saude.pt/), focuses on implementing a pilot software solution to support breast cancer diagnosis by integrating MammoGraphy (MG), UltraSound (US), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities. The system leverages an AI agent to enhance radiologists' decision-making, reduce diagnostic errors, and improve workflow efficiency. The initiative includes explainability features, real-time diagnostic assistance, and training support for early-career radiologists, while also laying the foundation for a digital, data-centric hospital environment.

Additionally, this initiative was an important part of the [BreastScreening-AI](https://github.com/BreastScreeningAI) endeavor developments, a *spinoff* from [IST](http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/). The knowledge, prototypes, and user interface designs developed under MIMBCD-UI directly informed the clinical and technical foundations of the BreastScreening-AI project (SensiPerception, LDA). This continuity ensures that scientific rigor and human-centered design remain at the core of translational efforts aimed at deploying AI in real-world radiology workflows.
