Starting in 2015, the [Medical Imaging Multimodality Breast Cancer Diagnosis User Interface (MIMBCD-UI)](https://mimbcd-ui.github.io/) initiative involves the collaborative effort of three Portuguese Research Institutions: [ISR](http://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/), [ITI](http://iti.larsys.pt/) and [INESC-ID](http://www.inesc-id.pt/). The three laboratories are [Associate Laboratories](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/research-and-innovation/rd/associate-laboratories/) of [IST](http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) from [ULisboa](https://www.ulisboa.pt/) - [Portugal](https://www.portugal.gov.pt/) ([EU](https://europa.eu/)). The [MIMBCD-UI](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI) initiative is the precursor of both [MIDA](https://github.com/mida-project) and [BreastScreening](https://github.com/BreastScreening) initiatives. In 2022, the team was funded by a national [FCT](https://www.fct.pt/) project, namely [Multiple Instance Attention Learning for Multimodal Breast Cancer (MIA-BREAST)](https://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/projects/multiple-instance-attention-learning-for-multimodal-breast-cancer-diagnosis/) with the FCT reference `2022.04485.PTDC` (DOI: [10.54499/2022.04485.PTDC](https://doi.org/10.54499/2022.04485.PTDC)), receiving contributions from the [MIMBCD-UI](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI) initiative. Additionally, this initiative was an important part of the [BreastScreening-AI](https://github.com/BreastScreeningAI) endeavor developments, a *spinoff* from [IST](http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/). For further information, follow the [public wiki](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta/wiki) of the [MIMBCD-UI](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI) initiative. Moreover, we also provide a [private wiki](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta-private/tree/master/wiki) on the [`meta-private`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta-private) repository for team usage.
